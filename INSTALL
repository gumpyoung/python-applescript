It's strongly recommended to install Terminator using fink.
If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy 
python-applescript dependencies yourself:

* Python 2.4+
* Python headers and development librairies
* Carbon headers and development librairies

To install properly, run : 

python setup.py build
python setup.py install --record=install-manifest.txt

For each command you can use the --help flag for an overview of
available options.

setup.py does not provide uninstallation, but all installed files 
are recorded in install-manifest.txt (see above).

Uninstallation process is done by manually removing each of these files.

python-applescript 0.1
by Olivier Hervieu <olivier.hervieu@gmail.com>.

The goal of this project is to provide a very small library that is able to 
launch applescript scripts.

The module implements one method called 'launch_script'. This method takes
one parameters : the script as a string.
It returns the output of the executed script as a string.

If the script contains errors, it raises an applescript.AppleScriptError 
exception.
